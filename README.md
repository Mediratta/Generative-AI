#  Equilibrium Ranking for Consistent AI Model Outputs
## Problem Definition:
The Consensus Game is a game-theoretic approach to language model decoding. It treats the decoding process as a complex game of clues and signals, where a generator tries to send the right message to a discriminator using natural language. The goal is to find an equilibrium where both parts agree on the correct message, ensuring accurate and coherent predictions.
## Project Steps:
1.Data Preparation: Prepare the datasets for the tasks to be performed, such as reading comprehension, commonsense reasoning, math problem-solving, and dialogue.
2.Model Selection: Choose the language models to be used, such as LLaMA-7B, and explain why they were selected.
3.Game-Theoretic Approach: Implement the game-theoretic method called "equilibrium ranking" to find approximate equilibria of the game.
4. Training and Testing: Train and test the model on the prepared datasets, evaluating its performance and comparing it to other methods.
5.Integration and Enhancement: Integrate the outputs of the current method to enhance the base model, resulting in more factual and consistent answers across various tasks.
## Technologies Used:
1. Python: The primary programming language for the project.
2. PyTorch: A popular deep learning framework used for building and training the language models.
3. NLTK: A natural language processing library used for text preprocessing and tokenization.
4. Spacy: A modern natural language processing library used for tokenization and entity recognition.
## Models Used:
LLaMA-7B: A large language model used as the base model for the project. It is chosen for its ability to generate coherent and accurate text.
## Why LLaMA-7B?
LLaMA-7B is chosen because of its large size and ability to generate coherent and accurate text. It is also a well-established model that has been used in various applications, making it a good choice for this project.
## Project Layout:
The project will be organized into the following directories and files:
1. data: Contains the datasets used for training and testing.
2. models: Contains the pre-trained language models used in the project.
3. src: Contains the source code for the project, including the game-theoretic approach and the training and testing scripts.
4. results: Contains the results of the training and testing, including performance metrics and visualizations.

## Methodology:
The project will follow the following methodology:
1. Data Preparation: Preprocess the datasets and split them into training and testing sets.
2. Model Selection: Choose the language models to be used and load them into the project.
3. Game-Theoretic Approach: Implement the game-theoretic method called "equilibrium ranking" to find approximate equilibria of the game.
4. Training and Testing: Train the model on the training set and test it on the testing set, evaluating its performance and comparing it to other methods.
5. Integration and Enhancement: Integrate the outputs of the current method to enhance the base model, resulting in more factual and consistent answers across various tasks.
