#  Equilibrium Ranking for Consistent AI Model Outputs
## Problem Statement:
In recent years, the development of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant advancements in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, these models often produce inconsistent and unreliable outputs, which can lead to errors in decision-making and other applications. This project aims to address this issue by developing a game-theoretic approach to improve the consistency and reliability of AI model outputs.
## Steps in the Project:
1. Data Collection:Aim is to collect a large dataset of text samples and corresponding labels.
dataset used :  This dataset contains thousands of questions and multiple-choice answers, which can be used to test the performance of equilibrium ranking methods in question-answering tasks
2. Model Selection: Selecting two AI models that are good at different aspects of the task. For example, ChatGpt is  excellent at generating creative text formats, while the perplexity ai  is better at understanding and explaining complex concepts.
3. Game Design: Designing a game where the two models interact with each other. In the game, the first model generates a cryptic message, and the second model tries to guess what the message is. They do this back and forth, and through this interaction, they both get better at their jobs.
4. Model Training: Training the models using the collected data and the game design.
5. Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
## Technologies Used:
1. Python: The primary programming language used for this project.
2. Transformers: A popular library for natural language processing tasks.
3. Perplexity AI: A library for building and training AI models.
4. TensorFlow: A popular library for building and training AI models.
## Models Used:
1. ChatGPT: A large language model developed by EleutherAI.
2. Perplexity AI: A library for building and training AI models.
## Why These Models?
ChatGPT is a well-known and widely used large language model that is excellent at generating creative text formats. Perplexity AI is a library that provides a range of AI models and tools for building and training AI models. By combining these two models, we can create a game-theoretic approach that improves the consistency and reliability of AI model outputs.
## Working Layout of the Project:
The project is structured as follows:
models: This directory contains the two AI models used in the project: ChatGPT and Perplexity AI.
data: This directory contains the dataset used to train the models.
game: This directory contains the game design and implementation.
evaluation: This directory contains the code for evaluating the performance of the models.

## Methodology:
The methodology used in this project is based on the game-theoretic approach. The two AI models interact with each other in a game, generating and guessing messages, and through this interaction, they both get better at their jobs. The game is designed to improve the consistency and reliability of AI model outputs.
## Conclusion:
This project aims to improve the consistency and reliability of AI model outputs by developing a game-theoretic approach. The project uses two AI models, ChatGPT and Perplexity AI, and a game design that encourages the models to interact with each other. The project is structured as follows: data collection, model selection, game design, model training, and evaluation. The technologies used in this project include Python, Transformers, Perplexity AI, and TensorFlow.
